This project involves a comprehensive analysis of game data from the "Game Analysis" database, focusing on various metrics to gain insights into player performance and game dynamics. Key tasks include extracting player details and their game levels, calculating stage progression and kill counts, identifying unique login dates, and summarizing lives earned. It also includes ranking top scores and headshots by device ID, determining first login date times, and calculating cumulative statistics such as total kill counts and stages crossed. Additionally, the project evaluates player performance against average scores and develops a stored procedure to dynamically rank top headshots. These analyses aim to enhance understanding of player engagement, performance, and device usage patterns
